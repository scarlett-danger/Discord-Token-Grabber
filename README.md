This script is designed to collect Discord tokens and user information by scanning local storage files from various browser applications and extensions such as Discord, Chrome, Opera, and others. It retrieves sensitive information like tokens, Nitro subscription details, servers (guilds), and other account details, then sends it to a Discord webhook in a formatted message.

### Requirements
- Python 3.11 or lower (not compatible with Python 3.12 or 3.13)
- Required libraries:
  - `win32crypt`
  - `pycryptodome` (for AES decryption)

**Note**: The required libraries will be automatically installed if they are not already present on the user's machine. This may take some time during the first execution as the missing modules are installed in the background.

Alternatively, you can manually install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pypiwin32 pycryptodome
```

---

### Usage
1. **Clone the repository or download the script**.
2. **Modify the webhook URL**: In the `main()` function, replace the placeholder `WEBHOOK_URL` with your actual Discord webhook URL.
3. **Run the script**: The script will search for the local data files of various browsers and Discord clients to extract the stored tokens.

```bash
python main.py
```

---

### Important Notes
- The script is designed for **Windows systems only** (due to the use of `win32crypt` and `LocalAppData`).
- **Make sure to use this script responsibly and only for ethical purposes**.
- **Do not use this script to steal personal data** or perform actions without the user's consent. Misusing this script is illegal.
